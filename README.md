# React Ecommerce Store Example

## Stack:

- `Vite`
- `React`
- `Netlify`
- `react-router-dom`
- `tailwindcss`

## Description

This is a simple example of an ecommerce platform made in React.
The platform is routed using `react-router-dom`, which makes this application a SPA (Single Page Application).

This application includes components for: `pages`, `sections` and `snippets` (following the Shopify formula).
Each page component is routed to using a `RouterProvider` from `react-router-dom`. All "page" links are made using the `Link` element from `react-router-dom`.

All central `cart` logic is handled in `App.js`.

## What I learned

- How to do routing.
- How to use tailwindcss.
- How to fetch REST API's using `useEffect()` hooks.
